# RAPTOR
Ram Air Parafoil Target Object Return (RAPTOR) is a system designed for automated return of high-altitude balloning payloads. 

'Kestrel' is part of the naming convention chosen for RAPTOR as it goes through various design and developement stages. Kestrel is the smallest raptor in North America, and was chosen to represent RAPTOR's first iteration, or the '0.5' version of the project.
